编译器与解释器的区别，
![[Pasted image 20251011170503.png]]
- history :1954 ibm develops 704,software costs >hardware costs
- 这就使人思考如何更好地去写软件
- speedcoding:1953 解释器早期例子。比手写执行效率缓慢10-20倍。占用大的内存空间 300bytes=30%ofthe machine
- fortran I 1954-1957 :写下公式机器可以执行的公式。formula translated.
	- the first compiler,huge impact on computer science(theory+practice)
	- led to an enormous body of theoretical work
	- modern compilers preserve the outline of FORTRAN I
- the outline
	1. Lexical Analysis  |
	2. Parsing                   ---(Syntactic)
	3. Semantic Analysis(Types,scopr)
	4. Optimization
	5. Code Generation(Translation)

# Why are there so many programming languages?

==Application domains have distinctive/conflicting needs.==
(it is hard to design one system for all)
- scientific computing.(need) Fortran
	- good fp
	-  good arrays
	- parallelism

- business applications SQL
	- persistence 可靠不易丢失
	- report generation
	- data analysis
- system programming  C/C++
	- control of resources
	- real time constriants
	- 时空资源

## Why are there are new programming languages?


==programmer training is the dominant cost for a programming language.==
new languages tend to look like old languages.(java vs c++)
- predictions
	1.  widely used languages are slow to change
	2. easy to start a new language(生产力> traning cost)
	3. Languages adopted to fill a void.(时代技术的进步发展)


## What is a good programming languages?

there is no universally accepted metric for language design.
