echoes start as a cross in you

trembling noises that come too soon 

spatial movement which seems to you

resonating your mask or feud

hollow talking and  a hollow girl

force it up from the root of pain

never said it was good never said it was near

shadow rises and you are here

and then you cut 

you cut it out

and everything goes back to the beginning

slience seizes a clouded room

light is shed not a breath too soon

darkness rises in all you do

standing and drawn out across the room

spatial movements are butterflies

shadows scatter without a fire

there's never been bad

there has always been truth

muted whisper the things she'll move

never said it was good never said it was near

muted whisper the things you'll feel
